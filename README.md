# Cidco MailStation
The MailStation is a Z80 based device from the 20th Century used primarily for email using the POTS (PSTN dial up).<br>

It has a Z80??<br>

W.I.P.Z. ... ?<br>
(Will It Play Zork?)<br>

Apparently [YES!](https://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/images.php)<br>

Unfortunately it seems there is not much active interest or development on the MailStation ... ?<br>

## [Memory Remapping](/Memory_Remap/)
Thanks to FyberOptic's work detailed [here](https://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/), I have reproduced his schematic and designed this small board to reorganise the memory map of the MailStation so that it might run CP/M.<br>
